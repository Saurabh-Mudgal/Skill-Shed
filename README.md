## Skill Shed
Repo to trial and scribble my frequent soft skill developments. Just a place for personal documentation, absolutely null if you're looking for something productive. In that case, I'd recommend you to check out my more resourceful repositories. :blush:

* [_Basic Python-3 Workshop_](https://github.com/Saurabh-Mudgal/IEEE-Python_Workshop-2018)
* [_Solving  the Fibonacci Sequence_](https://github.com/Saurabh-Mudgal/Fibonacci_Sequence_-C-)
