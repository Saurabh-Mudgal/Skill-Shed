# Reflection of Semester 2, Year 1 at NTU

The semester spanned from January to May, 2018. A first time experience was a 3 days get-away to Bali with friends in the recess week. The period seems pretty brief but it was my best bargain turning an absolute no from my parents and into okay go, but... 3 days only. It was an enriching experience and not just the trip itself but pre and post tasks taught me a lot. Also witnessed Tarang for the first time (It's an informal cultural and sports event among the Indian students in Singapore where we compete for a victory with no prize). Apart from this the semester was a lot of retrospection and lethargic, almost reluctant attention paid to my academics. For the same reasons I'm not expecting much out of this semester. But,

(self-copyrighted quote lol). I am genuinely motivated to do better in coming semesters and life years.

#### Expected Grade: B+
#### Actual Grade:

##### The assesment was divided into 5 parts:

- Quiz 1 - **10 %** weightage, MCQ midterm quiz in lecture hours, much harder than expect partially because my preperation wasn't done to my satisfaction (Grade: C-)
- Quiz 2 - **10 %** weightage, MCQ midterm quiz in lecture hours, much harder than expected cause the examiner was set it hard cause "he wanted us to learn so that we gain actual knowledge not marks"... yeah cause no one looks at your gpa so well I'll fuck that up a little so that you think all your preparation is good for nothing. I could've prepared even better albeit I made sure to put in more efforts than last time. (Grade: C+)
- Quiz 3: **10 %** weightage, MCQ midterm quiz in lecture hours (**MCed** but not really but cause Avengers Infinity War fan event the day before. Sad part is all my friends told me this one was a joke, complete opposite to what last quizes were :( RDJ, Karen Gillian and Benedict Cummberbatch. Worth it!) (MC)
- Class Participation: **10%** weightage, attend classers but more importantly answer questions, ask questions and make sure at the end of the day tutor remembers your face. (B-)
- LAMS sequence: **10 %** weightage. Complete the LAMS sequence on time. One each week. Given upto two weeks (ie, if 1st LAM, week 2 Sunday night deadline, although to be accurate they are Monday 8 AM of week 3... and so on for upcoming weeks). (A+)
- Final Exam: **50 %** weightage (60 % for me beacause the MCed quiz don't have re-test albeit their weightage is carried over to final exam). ( )

##### **Experience:** 

DON'T LET THE TWO WEEKS DEADLINE FOR LAMS FOOL YOU! Do it as soon as you can and do it seriously. Make your own notes while watching the LAMS sequence. Then get down to doing the tutorials (easy-peesy, there are just 2-3 small questions. refer to those lecture notes you made if you need). Finally, just skim through the lecture notes you made to give your knowledge a finishing shine (5 min tops). That's it. You're done for the week studying for this course.

The second half of this course is the revision lectures and tutorials. Revision lectures, as the name suggest, revise briefly the important concepts you learnt in that weeks LAMs. They're a good time to directly interact with the proffesor, ask him doubts if you have any, build a rapoort with him (whoo knows he might agree to take on your research project or supervise your [**FYP**](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/mklho/FYP_COMMENCING_SEM_1.pdf) ([FYP format](http://www.mae.ntu.edu.sg/Programmes/CurrentStudents/Graduate(Coursework)/MScProgrammes/IndependentStudy/Pages/ReportWritingGuidelines.aspx)) in the coming year).

They're really helpful. You should take your handmade lecture notes with you. At the end of lecture, see if there are any corrections you want to make or anything new you wish to add. I learn't this the hard way by not attending any and only watching the recorded lectures so far in the end that it was too late. As a rule of thumb, only use lecture recordings as a backup and try to attend all lectures diligently. That should be your primary mode of learning. 

The last part, yet an important one is the tutorials. Surprisingly enough you still learn a lot in tutorials despite self-study and lectures (But don't mistakenly use this fact to justify not doing any of the previously mentioned just cause you will learn a lot in tutorials. If you take this approach, YOU WILL NOT. If you pre-learn and come you will learn more. The tutorial will be a hot commodity for you Otherwise, it will  just make your head a hot mess). Not to miss, participate in the tutorial. Ask any questions you have without waiting, without hesitation. You aren't being polite by waiting for the tutor to push you to ask any questions you have. Class is limited to 20 for a reason. Got a question, ask it! (One place they really don't judge you for stupid questions)

Any question the tutor asks, answer right away. Don't wait for anyone else to warm up the crowd. Since this isn't NBS its unlikely that you will be in an energetically participating audience. But don't be a part of that audience. Rise above it and use it to your and everybody's advantage. By being the first to answer, you obviously gain in the tutors eyes. You'll also break the ice and promote others to participate creating a very positive environment for everyone.

That is it. If you can do this. Consistently. Every/ Most weeks. You got another A+ in the bag.
